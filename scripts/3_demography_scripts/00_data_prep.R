#### PROJECT: Evolutionary rescue of Mimulus cardinalis populations during extreme drought
#### PURPOSE OF THIS SCRIPT: Tidy raw demographic vital rate data in preparation for IPM analyses

#*******************************************************************************
#### 1. Clean workspace and load required packages
#*******************************************************************************

# Remove objects and clear workspace
rm(list = ls(all=TRUE))

# Easy code for installing packages in R (if not installed) and calling their libraries
# From: https://gist.github.com/DrK-Lo/a945a29d6606b899022d0f03109b9483

# Make vector of packages needed
packages_needed <- c("tidyverse")

# Install packages needed (if not already installed)
for (i in 1:length(packages_needed)){
  if(!(packages_needed[i] %in% installed.packages())){install.packages(packages_needed[i])}
}

# Load packages needed
for (i in 1:length(packages_needed)){
  library( packages_needed[i], character.only = TRUE)
}
